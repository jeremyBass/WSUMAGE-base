# WSU Magento Production Environment
## How to Put into production
Generally if you are ready to push changes up to the server it will be done through the server administrator unless you are placing a new installation.  There are going to be two types of updates; a new theme for your site, or a new extension.

**Note** All new extension must be tested and installed by the [WSU University Web Communications Team](https://github.com/washingtonstateuniversity)

### Pushing a theme to production
As a designer, you would be using [Grunt task runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to test you theme and push it to production in one step.
