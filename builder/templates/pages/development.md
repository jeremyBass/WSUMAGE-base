# WSU Magento development guide

### How to do development</h2>
There is an ideal way to development for Magento against the WSUMAGE-base repo.  First you must load the project up under the WSU-Web-Serverbase repo.  This will give you a copy of the production version of the site through a local development area.  This area is a Vagrant controlled a headless VirtualBox.  Once this project is loaded with in the serverbase, you will be able to push changes to this local live site.
