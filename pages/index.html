		  <p>This is a Magento web app repo.  This is loaded in to a server base project such as <a href="https://github.com/washingtonstateuniversity/WSU-Web-Serverbase">https://github.com/washingtonstateuniversity/WSU-Web-Serverbase</a> .  This project may be loaded with other web apps as well, but it's all loaded in with the server base.  A web app can't live without the server.  The steps to get this project up is </p>
		  <ol>
			<li>
			  <p>git clone the server base </p>
			  <pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:washingtonstateuniversity/WSU-Web-Serverbase.git wsuweb</code>
<code>$ cd wsuweb</code></pre>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p>git clone the web app to the app folder </p>
			  <pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:washingtonstateuniversity/WSUMAGE-base.git app/store.wsu.edu</code></pre>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p>From the server root folder, just vagrant up and the app will be installed with the </p>
			  <pre><code>$ vagrant up</code></pre>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you have your local server up already, including a new app is simple.  All that is needed is to call the highstate for salt from the server.  To do this fallow these steps:</p>
			  <pre><code>$ vagrant ssh</code>
<code>$ su      #note the password is `vagrant`</code>
<code>$ salt-call state.highstate env=store.wsu.edu</code></pre>
				<p>From here the app will install and you will be able to start working with the store.</p>
			</li>
		  </ol>
		  <p>Those are the steps for your local dev environment.  You may also highstate the project on its own, but it must be on a ready server.  That is <code>salt-call state.highstate env=store.wsu.edu</code>. </p>
		  <p>More will come.  Thank you for reading.</p>
