		<p>This project is used in aiding your development and web design tasks. To achieve this result of a simple get up and running environment, we use <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> along with a <a href="http://www.saltstack.com/" target="_blank">Salt</a> provisioner to set up the local server and deploy the web apps.  You have the option to edit the <code>Vagrantfile</code>, it is highly suggested to now alter the file in any way.  To set options for  <code>Vagrant</code> there are properties located in the <code>config.json</code>.  From this <code>config.json</code> you may load up any of the pre configured apps, adjust the way vagrant is run, and which environments are loaded with <code>Salt</code>.  </p>

	<h3>How to add a web app?</h3>
	<p>Loading a web app is very straight forward.  You simply <code>git clone</code> in the app of choice into the <code>app/</code> folder at the root for the server folder.  You may load as many apps as you wish to, but it should be noted if you need to simulate one server talking with another, then you will want to have two instances of this project and load the web app respectively.</p>
